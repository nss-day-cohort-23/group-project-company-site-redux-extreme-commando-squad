  <h1>- Our History -</h1>
  <p>
    At Throwin' Shades, we strive to create products that are extremely unimportant to your survival, but vital to your coolness level. We started the company in 2007 with a single goal in mind: create the most bitchin' pair of shades the world has ever seen. Everyone comes into work each morning with protected eyes and bright smiles because we only want to make the world a better (read: swaggier) place.
